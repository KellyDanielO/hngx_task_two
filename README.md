## Project Description
Welcome to the Mobile CV Application, a user-friendly and feature-rich platform designed to serve as your comprehensive CV. This sleek and intuitive mobile app allows you to effortlessly showcase your personal and professional details while providing the flexibility to view and edit your CV information on the go.

## About Me

Hello, I'm Kelly Daniel, and I'm excited to share the successful completion of the Mobile CV Application task as part of Stage Two.

### Key Highlights

Here are some key highlights of my work on the Mobile CV Application:

- **User-Centric Design:** I placed a strong emphasis on user experience, ensuring that the application is intuitive and easy to navigate. From the initial CV viewing page to the editing capabilities, my goal was to create a seamless and enjoyable experience for users.

- **Native Development:** To ensure stability and security, I developed the application exclusively using the native capabilities of the mobile platform. This means that the app doesn't rely on any third-party tools, packages, plugins, or libraries, providing a robust foundation for future enhancements.

- **Real-Time Updates:** One of the standout features of the app is its ability to reflect changes in real-time. After editing CV details, users can simply return to the home/first page to see their alterations immediately. No manual refresh is required, making it a convenient tool for keeping CVs up to date.

### What's Next

I'm excited to present this Mobile CV Application and am open to feedback and questions from the community. This project has been a fantastic learning experience for me, and I'm eager to continue exploring and improving mobile app development.

Feel free to explore the app in action and check out the GitHub repository for a deeper dive into the code. Your insights and suggestions are greatly appreciated as I continue to refine and expand my skills in the world of mobile app development.

Thank you for considering my work, and I look forward to any future opportunities and challenges that lie ahead!

Happy coding!
